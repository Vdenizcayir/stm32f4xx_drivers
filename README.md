# stm32f4xx_drivers

#The main purpose of this project is to get an insight into the STM32F407 Discovery Board, which is an ARM Cortex M4 based Microcontroller. As I started working on #STM32F07 Discovery Board, initially it was difficult and confusing to understand and program this microcontroller because understanding internal structures and #working of the microcontroller using datasheet of STM32F407VGT MCU is difficult especially if one is a beginner.
